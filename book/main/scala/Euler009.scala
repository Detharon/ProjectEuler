/**
 * Problem 9: A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
 *
 * a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^
 *
 * For example 3^2^ + 4^2^ = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2^.
 *
 * There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
 *
 * Find the product abc.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Explanation: The numbers are low enough for a naive approach, so let's use it, while keeping the code nice and clean.
 * We need to check all combinations of a, b, c fpr which a + b + c = 1000 and find those that form a Pythagorean triplet.
 *
 * This naive algorithm start from the highest possible 'c', keeps the sum of parameters at 1000, while gradually
 * incrementing 'b' and decrementing 'c' until this it's possible. This condition (b == c - 2 || b == c - 1) indicates
 * that the next triangle can't be created this way, so we need to increase the 'a' instead, while resetting the other
 * two parameters: 'b' to the lowest possible one, 'c' to whatever will give a sum of 1000.
