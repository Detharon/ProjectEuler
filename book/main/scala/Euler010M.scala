/**
 * Problem 10: The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17
 * Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Explanation: It's the perfect problem to use the sieve of Eratosthenes. If you've never heard about it, then I
 * suggest looking it up, as it will be used in the future problems as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
 *
 * Unfortunately, the sieve itself doesn't go along well with immutable data structures because its creation is done
 * iteratively, by small incremental changes.
 *
 * In this solution, we're filling the sieve, which initially considers all numbers to be primes (true) and marks the
 * multiples of existing primes as non-primes (false). Once we hit next number, we know that if its factors were not
 * found already, then it's a prime. No need for any another check!
 *
 * While filling the sieve, we'll also calculate the primeSum to avoid iterating the array. It makes it even more mutable
 * with a global state, but also faster.
 *
 * We could also cut the numbers of elements stored by twice if we don't check the even numbers, we know that they are
 * not primes, but that would make the solution more complex. We could also use a more memory-efficient structure, such
 * as BitSet, which requires 1 bit to store 1 number, as compared to array of booleans where we need 1 byte to store
 * a boolean. It would also increase the complexity, since BitSets are a bit more tricky to handle. Could also decrease
 * the performance, but I haven't checked that.
