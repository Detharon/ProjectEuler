# About this repository
It's a collection of solutions for the first 100 problems of the Project Euler.

They're published by me purely for educational purposes, so you can take a look at how they can be solved in Scala.
The solutions presented here prioritize readability over efficiency, yet they should always finish at most in a
couple of seconds on most machines.

I also tried to make the code idiomatic whenever possible, by avoiding mutable states and vars.

## About Project Euler
https://projecteuler.net/about

Project Euler is a website that hosts computational problems requiring both computer science and mathematics
knowledge. There's no goal or a reward besides your own satisfaction, so before looking into solutions, make sure
that you've solved the problem yourself first, or spent significant time before giving up.
