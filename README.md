# About this repository

This repository contains solutions for the first 100 problems from the Project Euler website.

The code is shared for educational purposes, demonstrating how these problems can be approached using Scala.
The focus of the implementations is on readability rather than raw performance, though most of the solutions should
complete within a few seconds on typical hardware.

Where possible, a functional programming style is used, avoiding mutable state and vars.
Some solutions intentionally deviate from this approach for performance comparison; these are marked with an ‘M’ suffix
in their filenames. 

While the non-functional style may yield greater efficiency by reducing object allocations, it often results in less
readable and more error-prone code, so it is included primarily for contrast and learning purposes.

## About Project Euler

https://projecteuler.net/about

Project Euler is a collection of challenging computational and mathematical problems designed to promote learning and
problem-solving. Participants are encouraged to attempt solving each problem independently before consulting existing
solutions.
