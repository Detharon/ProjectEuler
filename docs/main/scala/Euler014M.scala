/**
 * The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
 *
 * n -> n / 2 (n is even)
 * n -> 3n + 1 (n is odd)
 *
 * Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
 *
 * 13 -> 40 -> 20 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1
 *
 * It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms.
 * Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
 *
 * Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
 *
 * '''NOTE''': Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Explanation: Uses memoization with an array-based cache for fast lookups. Why array? Because map would be much
 * slower and we know its max size. In fact, we don't have to cache all the values. You can try it out yourself
 * by limiting the 'cacheLimit' to 100_000. It should be slower, but still faster than the brute-force solution.
 *
 * As you see we get rid of the optimization to start from 500_000. That's because, it turns out, it works slightly
 * slower than starting from the beginning, because our cache has a lot of misses this way, and we don't backtrace the
 * values to fill it.
 *
 * We could try to do it, but is it worth increasing the complexity of the solution even further, if it already runs in
 * milliseconds? Sometimes it is, but here I'll pass. If it wasn't a computational problem, but a logical one, then the
 * base, immutable solution would be the one preferred in almost all the instances, due to how simple and safe it is.
 *
 * This solution has much more places where errors can be made. For example, the 'n.toInt' is only safe because we
 * check right before that n is below a cache limit, which prevents the overflow.
