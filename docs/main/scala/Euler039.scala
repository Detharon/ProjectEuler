   * Problem 39: perimeter If 'p' is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
   * {a, b, c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.
   * {20, 48, 52}, {24, 45, 51}, {30, 40, 50}
   *
   * For which value of p <= 1000 is the number of solutions maximised?
   *
   * --------------------------------------------------
   *
   * We could just check all the possible values of a, b, c and check if they follow the Pythagorean theorem,
   * a^2^ + b^2^ = c^2^, but we can reduce the number of possibilities to check since we also know that
   * the sum of two length sides must be greater than the length of the third side, that is: a + b > c.
   *
   * For example, for a perimeter of 120, we know that one side has to be smaller than 60, because the sum of
   * two sides has to be greater than the third side. The upper bound, then, is perimeter / 2 - 1.
