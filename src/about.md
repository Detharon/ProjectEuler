# About this guide

This guide contains solutions for the first 100 problems from the Project Euler website.

The code is shared for educational purposes, demonstrating how these problems can be approached using Scala. The focus
of the implementations is on readability rather than raw performance, though most of the solutions should complete
within a few seconds on a typical hardware.

Where possible, a functional programming style is used, avoiding mutable state and vars. Some solutions intentionally
deviate from this approach for performance comparison; these are marked with an ‘M’ suffix in their filenames.

While the non-functional style may yield greater efficiency by reducing object allocations, it often results in less
readable and more error-prone code, so it is included primarily for contrast and learning purposes.
