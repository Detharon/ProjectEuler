# About this guide

This guide contains solutions for the first 100 problems from the Project Euler website.

The code is shared for educational purposes, demonstrating how these problems can be approached using Scala.
There are many other sites that discuss Project Euler problems, but here, the purpose it twofold:
discuss the problem while emphasizing Scala's strengths and show code that's both efficient and idiomatic,
easy to read and powerful.

So, whenever possible, a functional programming style is used, avoiding mutable state and vars. Some solutions
intentionally deviate from this approach for performance comparison;
these are marked with an ‘M’ suffix in their filenames.

While the non-functional style may yield greater efficiency by reducing object allocations, it often results in less
readable and more error-prone code, so it is included primarily for contrast and learning purposes.

## Contributing

It's an individual works, that's heavily influenced by my personal style, but I'm open for contributions.
If you want to add your some extra insights, you've found an error or a mistake, please send a pull request
or raise an issue in GitHub.

## Project status

The project it still in progress, with many problems missing.
