# Sum Square Difference

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

\\(1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385\\)

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

\\((1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025\\)

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is

\\(3025 - 385 = 2640\\)

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## Solution

It's a pretty straightforward problem. We can simply write down the problem literally, without any optimizations, and
we're good to go. Scala's expressiveness makes this task a breeze and the resulting code is easy to understand.

To make it extra concise, let's also define a "square" extension method.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/Euler006.scala}}
```
