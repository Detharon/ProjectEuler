# 10 001st Prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10001st prime number?

## Solution

We can simply brute-force this problem by using the most naive prime check, since the 10001st prime will be a low 
number. This solution is pretty fast, even though the algorithm is not very efficient.

As you can see, we don't even filter out even numbers higher than 2 (or all the multiplies of already found primes),
but we'll need these methods later on. For now, a basic algorithm does pretty well.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/Euler007.scala}}
```

And for the reference, that's how we check if a number is a prime. A brute-force solution, that ran in 13 ms on my
machine, which is pretty good already.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/EulerHelper.scala:6:11}}
```
