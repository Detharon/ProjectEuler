# Multiples of 3 or 5
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Explanation: The only tricky part of this exercise comes from the fact that we cannot simply count the multiplies of 3,
then calculate the multiplies of 5, and add these two numbers up. If we did that, then the numbers that are divisible
by 3 and 5 would be calculated twice.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/Euler001.scala}}
```

The problem can be also solved using the modulo operator

```scala
(3 until 1000).filter(n => n % 3 == 0 || n % 5 == 0).sum
```
