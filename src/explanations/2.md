# Even Fibonacci Numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.
By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

The numbers are small enough to calculate it in a matter of milliseconds without any optimisations. 
Fibonacci implementation is done with a LazyList to make it infinite. Is this an efficient approach?
Not really, because `LazyList` memoizes all the elements, but we need just the previous 2.

In this case, due to how easy this task is, let's keep it as it is.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/Euler002.scala}}
```
