# Largest Palindrome Product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 
2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 * 99

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## Solution

A brute-force solution would also work reasonably well, but we can actually reduce the number of numbers to be checked.

We know that multiplying two 3-digit numbers will give us a 6-digit number at most, 
so the palindrome we're looking for has the "abccba" form, or: 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100c + 10b + a.

If we add those numbers we get "100001a + 10010b + 1100c". 
We can then factor out 11, which means that our palindrome has to be divisible by 11: 11(9091a + 910b + 100c)

One of the numbers then has to be divisible by 11, because it's a prime number. 
We can start from 990 instead of 999 and decrease the numbers checked by 11.

As for checking if a string is a palindrome, there are many ways to do that. It can be done iteratively, recursively,
or with built-in functions like here. Neither changes the run time, so it doesn't matter much for this problem.
