# Factorial Digit Sum

\\(n!\\) means \\(n \times (n - 1) \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1\\).

For example, \\(10! = 10\times 9 \times ... \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800\\),
and the sum of the digits in the number \\(10!\\) is \\(3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27\\).

Find the sum of the digits in the number \\(100!\\).

## Solution

Thanks to Scala's extensive standard library, we can represent the factorial in question as a regular 
`BigInt`. It even has a convenient `.factorial` method.

Once we have the result of \\(100!\\), we can recursively read it, digit by digit, using the modulo division.

```scala
{{#include ../main/scala/Euler020.scala}}
```
